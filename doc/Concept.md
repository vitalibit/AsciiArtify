# AsciiArtify Concept
**Introduction:** Description of the tools and their purpose.

   -   Minikube: A tool that helps in running a single-node Kubernetes cluster on a local machine.
   -   Kind: A tool that allows running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.
   -   K3d: A lightweight wrapper to run Rancher k3s in Docker, which allows creating single-node and multi-node k3s clusters in    Docker for local development.
   -   Podman: An open-source container engine that provides a complete set of management tools for managing containers and images.

| Minikube | Supports multiple Kubernetes versions.                                                  | Struggles to set up the first time.                                                   |
|          | Provides built-in Kubernetes dashboard for monitoring and management.                   | Many options are difficult to use or require manual setup.                            |
|          | Supports integration with other tools such as Helm and Draft.                           | Requires shutting down Minikube when finished because of the VM’s drain on resources. |
|          | Easy to install and set up.                                                             | Least widely used.                                                                    |
